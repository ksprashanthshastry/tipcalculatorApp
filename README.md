This was a front end development Challenge I took up from Front end mentor to practice and understand the concepts i have learnt until now. 

I tried to get the app running, but there are a few hiccups in the app. 

I would love it if anyone could review it and help me understand if there is a better way to get the app running efficirently. 

Right now, i am getting the total per person and tip per person rendered everytime the tip buttons are clicked. 
I have spent a lot of time thinking how to render the totals field without waiting for button clicks. 

The problem I faced was that everytime the tip button is clicked, the setstate would render the total values and woud result in infinity or NaN values.I had to click the button again to rerender the correct value. 

Any advice would be helful.
